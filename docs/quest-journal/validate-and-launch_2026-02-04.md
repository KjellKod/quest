# Quest Journal: validate-and-launch

**Quest ID:** validate-and-launch_2026-02-04__1045
**Completed:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Complete

## Summary

First-ever quest run on the extracted repository. Validated that the Quest blueprint was correctly extracted from the source repo, created the `ideas/` directory for tracking future work, and updated the README with public domain messaging.

**What was built:**
- Validated all required files present (allowlist, roles, hooks, gitignore)
- Created `ideas/` directory with seed ideas (installer script, CI validation, commit-time validation)
- Updated README with public domain messaging and usage guidance

## Key Changes

- `ideas/` directory established as the place for future work items
- README updated with welcoming, casual tone for public use
- Confirmed `.quest/` properly gitignored and system functional

## Impact

This quest proved the system works end-to-end in its new standalone home. The ideas seeded here (installer, CI validation) became full quests later.

## Iterations

- Plan iterations: 1
- Fix iterations: 1
- Review verdict: Approved
