When we do update check, we just say "it's aupdate" 
Maybe we can store or extract? the "title" of each squach commit? 
or providing them with a link for details about the changes (easiest quest/changelog.md)
what's the best user experience for this thing? 
if we had a change log we can look at the checksum where we are at and then take anyting above it. 
<whatever update is available, would you like to download the update?> [Y/n/info]
