# CI workflow for Python tests (Quest Dashboard).
# Runs unit and integration tests on every push/PR to main.
#
# To add as a required status check:
#   1. Go to Settings > Branches > Branch protection for "main"
#   2. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#   3. Search for "Test Python / test" and select it
#
# Note: The check name only appears after the workflow has run at least once.
